        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: [IM Fell French Canon SC]</h4>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: [Lato, Helvetica, sans-serif]</h4>
        
        <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
        <p>
            IM Fell French Canon SC exudes an air of historical sophistication, ideal for projects that require a classical touch, such as book design and formal invitations. In contrast, Lato offers a modern and friendly appeal with its semi-rounded details, making it versatile for both digital and print media, from websites to corporate branding. Helvetica stands out with its clean and neutral design, embodying the essence of versatile sans-serif fonts; it is widely used in advertising, signage, and logos for its professional and timeless appearance. Overall, these typefaces bring unique qualities to any design, allowing for a wide range of creative possibilities tailored to specific project needs.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
        <p class="colored">
            This paragraph uses a vibrant color palette from Coolors to create an engaging visual effect. The text is colored a bright red (#DB324D), which immediately draws attention. The background of the paragraph is a soft green (#BDD358), providing a pleasant and calming contrast to the red text. To add an additional layer of interest, a vibrant orange border (#EFA00B) is applied to the left side of the paragraph, making it stand out even more. All of this is set against a clean, white background (#FFFFFF), ensuring that the colors pop and the text remains highly readable. This combination of colors and design elements creates a visually appealing and dynamic paragraph that captures the reader's attention.
